# Gobang
This is a GUI Java Gobang game implemented by min-max algorithm.

The evalution function is based on such principle. 
```
”22“,2
"222",8
"2222",30
"22222",1000
"21",1
"211",6
"2111",20
"21111",70
"2022",7
"20222",25
"2011",4
```
In the principle, "2" represents self, "1" represents the opponent and "0" represents space. The value after the comma is the weight of this case.th
